I am a member of Economics Department of Kadir Has University. My current research focuses on the economic history of Turkey since the World War I, the regional inequalites, West-East divide, industry location and railroads. I am also interested in the social science applications of the state-of-the-art computational methods in statistical programming, data visualization, text mining and spatial analysis.
