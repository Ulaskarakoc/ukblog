I used to solve math problems and read history, politics and literature in my spare time when I was in the high school. Little has changed since. As a researcher, I am both interested in the grand questions of economic history, and the mathematical properties of the statistical distributions. Putting differently, I like both ideas and numbers.

I am currently working on the regional inequalities, the great West-East Divide, economic impact of railroads and industrial location in Turkey since the late 19th century. Also, I am working on the applications of text mining algorithms to understand Turkey's firm history.
